# AlphaTrader

AlphaTrader is a modern web application built using React and Python, which allows users to backtest various trading strategies and compare the alpha & beta generated. Trading strategies can be customized, allowing users to fine tune the algorithm and have full control over the trades being made.

The web application shows a list of the trades being performed and their details, allowing users to debug and optimize the processes of their chosen strategy.

Users can also train machine-learning based strategies for a variety of timeframes before backtesting the strategy.

The UI of AlphaTrader is built with Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap, and the graphs are rendered using Chart.js.
